# Standard Contributing  
  
> A standard for CONTRIBUTING.md files

If your README tells others how to use your code, your CONTRIBUTING file is where you let others know how they can give back. It is where you say how to log issues, how to make pull requests, and how to go from being a user to becoming a team member. Standardizing your CONTRIBUTING document makes it easier to write and maintain contribute guidelines for all of your projects. 

This repository contains:  
- A writeup of why writing a great CONTRIBUTING.md is important (in this file)
- The [specification](spec.md) for what a Contribute file should contain.  
- A link to [a generator](TODO) for standard-contributing compliant CONTRIBUTING.md files.
- Some examples.  
  
Standard-Contributing is designed for open source code - but it also applies to inner or closed source code, as any code where new users may want to give back would benefit from a guide. It is also designed for GitHub workflows, although it should be adaptable to other platforms (GitLab, BitBucket, your home server).
